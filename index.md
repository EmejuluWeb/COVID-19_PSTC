This project has been set up as a repository for information and open code on pandemic symptom trackers. Websites/Apps of this kind are not available in all countries. The site provides international governments, academia, commercial companies and/or individuals a place to find examples, to share their sympton tracker open code, to fork code and to add other relevant app/website links. 

We are also developing open code for a colour-coded calendar/diary, designed as a sympton tracker add-on, using basic gamification tools to incentivize citizens to upload symptom data daily for at least 12 weeks.

Here is mock calendar design for encouranging the users of symptom tracker apps to report their symptoms daily over a 12 week period. As a user enter their symptoms the calendar fills with colour, rewarding the users for their continued reporting.
