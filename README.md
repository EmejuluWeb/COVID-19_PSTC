# COVID-19 CLoCK 

CLoCK (Citizens' Logbook capturing COVID-19 Knowledge) has been set up as a repository for open code supporting public feedback on the local spread of COVID-19. This particularly relates to citizen logs collecting data on mild symptoms, incubation periods etc. not picked up by formal recording processes. Apps of this kind do exist but these are not available in all countries. Simple gamification features designed to incentivize citizens to log their symptoms daily are also needed. The site provides a place for international governments, academia, commercial companies and/or individuals to share relevant code. New code may be forked by anyone and adapted to suit individual countries/regionsâ€™ circumstances/privacy requirements. New apps can also be highlighted using the site.
