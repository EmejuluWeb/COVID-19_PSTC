# COVID-19 Pandemic Symptom Trackers and Calendars.

This project has been set up as a repository for open code capturing public feedback on the local spread of COVID-19 including mild symptoms and incubation periods collected from households, not picked up by formal recording processes. Website/Apps of this kind do exist but are not available in all countries. Open code needs to be collated and shared. Simple design/gamification features also need to be created to incentivize citizens to add data daily, for at least 12 weeks to create a bigger picture. The site provides international governments, academia, commercial companies and/or individuals a place to share code, fork code and add international symptom survey links.
