# COVID-19 CLoCK 

CLoCK (Citizens' Logbook capturing COVID-19 Knowledge) has been set up as a repository for open code supporting public feedback on the local spread of COVID-19. The site focuses on ways in which data mild pandemic symptoms, incubation periods etc. are collected from households, not picked up by formal recording processes. Website/Apps of this kind do exist but are not available in all countries. Open code needs to be collated and shared. Simple design/gamification features also need to be created to incentivize citizens to add data daily, for several months to build the big picture. The site provides a place for international governments, academia, commercial companies and/or individuals to share code, fork code and add symptom survey links.
