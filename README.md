# COVID-19 CLoCK 

Citizens' Logbook capturing COVID-19 Knowledge, has been set up as a repository for open code supporting public feedback mechanisms relating to the local spread of COVID-19 and other pandemics, particularly relating to logs/book diaries collecting data on mild symptoms, incubation periods, likely immunity etc. not picked up by formal recording processes. Apps of this kind do already exist but these are not available in all countries.  The site provides a place for international governments, academia, commercial companies and/or individuals to share relevant code and information. Code deposited may be forked by anyone and adapted to suit individual countries/regionsâ€™ circumstances/privacy requirements. Adapted code can then be redistributed using the site. The site also looks to encourage collaborative work on simple gamification methods that incentivize citizens to help scientists, by logging their symptoms daily.
