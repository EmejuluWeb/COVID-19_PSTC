# COVID-19 CLoCK 

Citizens' Logbook capturing COVID-19 Knowledge, has been set up as a repository for open code designed to support public feedback mechanisms relating to the local spread of COVID-19. This specifically relates to  data on  mild symptoms, incubation periods, immunity and not on serious or tested cases already picked up in formal recording processes . We know apps of this kind already exist, but that these are not available in all countries.   The site provides a place for international governments, academia, commercial companies and/or individuals to share relevant code, and related information, for other countries to use. Code deposited ma  be forked by anyone and adapted to suit individual nationsâ€™ circumstances/privacy requirements. Adapted code can then be redistributed using the site. Callouts to the international community for coding help can also be made
