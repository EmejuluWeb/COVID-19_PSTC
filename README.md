This project has been set up as a repository for information and open code on pandemic symptom trackers. Websites/Apps of this kind are not available in all countries. The site provides international governments, academia, commercial companies and/or individuals a place to find examples, to share their sympton tracker open code, to fork code and to add other relevant app/website links. We are also developing open code for a colour-coded calendar/diary, designed as a sympton tracker add-on, using basic gamification tools to incentivize citizens to upload symptom data daily for at least 12 weeks. 

## How to Contribute:
