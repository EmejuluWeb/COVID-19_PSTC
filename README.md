# COVID-19 Pandemic Symptom Trackers and Calendars.

This project has been set up as a repository for information and open code on pandemic symptom trackers. Websites/Apps of this kind are not available in all countries. The site provides international governments, academia, commercial companies and/or individuals a place to find examples, to share their sympton tracker open code, to fork code and to add other relevant app/website links. We are also developing open code for an add-on colour-coded calendar/diary designed to incentivize citizens to upload symptom data daily for at least 12 weeks. 

## How to Contribute:
1. By Adding links to any symptom trackers you can find in the world to the [List of symptom tracker apps and websites](Symptom_tracker_apps_and_websites.md)
2. By helping us develop the open code 12 week calendar add-on.
